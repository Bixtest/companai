/**
 * D0 — the generated guard registry must actually DELIVER guards.
 *
 * This is the proof that closes D0. Before the fix, `guards.generated.ts`
 * exported `guardEntries = []` in the running app, because the only modules
 * that shipped a `data/guards.ts` were parked (`customers`, `customer_accounts`)
 * and the example module is off by default. The generator worked; nothing was
 * being delivered.
 *
 * THE POINT OF THIS TEST — it must not be able to pass vacuously:
 *
 *   - It imports the REAL generated file (no `jest.doMock` on guards.generated),
 *     so if the generator stops emitting entries, the assertion fails.
 *   - It pushes the entries through the REAL store the app uses
 *     (`registerMutationGuards` / `getAllMutationGuardInstances`), which is the
 *     same pair `bootstrap/factory.ts` calls — so if the store wiring breaks,
 *     the assertion fails.
 *   - It runs a REAL mutation through `runMutationGuards` for a reserved key and
 *     asserts it is blocked, and for a legitimate key and asserts it is allowed.
 *     A registry that delivers guards but a runner that ignores them fails here.
 *
 * If the generated file has no entries, the whole chain is dead and this test
 * reports it — it does not silently pass on an empty registry.
