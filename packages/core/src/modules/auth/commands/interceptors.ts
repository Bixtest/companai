 *
 * ## What it does not gate, deliberately
 *
 * - **Commands that declare no `capability`.** The resolver is keyed by
 *   capability and the bus by command; a command that has not been mapped is not
 *   gated, and the gap is visible rather than guessed at.
 * - **Tenants not in `enforce`.** Shadow mode observes and changes nothing.
 * - **`A0`.** That is a refusal and `RbacService` has already made it at the
 *   route guard, before any of this runs.
 * `A3` **is** held, but it ends differently: nobody has to answer it. A scheduled
 * sweep runs it once its window passes, and only a veto stops it.
 *
 * `A4` **is** covered too, and holds nothing — the act runs and `afterExecute`
 * files it for review, which is why this hook records the decision in the
 * interceptor metadata on its way past.
 * - **Replays of an already-approved act**, which would otherwise be held again
 *   and produce a queue that cannot be emptied.

 * wrong thing. A create has no id, and nothing is looked up for it.
 *
 * **Shape only — no version or variant constraint** (T-32). The pattern this
 * replaced demanded an RFC-4122 v1–v5 id: every v4 id passes and every v7 id
 * fails, so a v7-id record reached the resolver with `recordId: null`,
 * `resourceCeilingFor` returned early on `!recordId`, and no lock was looked up
 * at all. Version and variant are properties of the *generator* — the `uuid`
