/**
 * The gate that makes an obligation bind.
 *
 * Enforcement could refuse an act (`A0`) and nothing else. `A1` and `A2` — *"the
 * worker proposes; a human performs"* and *"executes only after approval"* —
 * were recorded as obligations while the act ran anyway, which is a control in
 * name only.
 *
 * What these tests protect is the narrow claim: **a held act does not run, and a
 * refused act does not run either** — and everything the gate declines to gate,
 * it declines to gate on purpose.
