/**
 * Structural guards for the dynamic-entity definition path.
 *
 * These run through the global mutation-guard registry (`guardEntries` in
 * `guards.generated.ts`, registered by `bootstrap/factory.ts`). They are the
 * central delivery path — not the per-route hand-wired calls — so every write
 * that reaches `beginEntitiesMutationGuard` sees them.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * The registry was delivering nothing: the only modules that shipped a
 * `data/guards.ts` were parked (`customers`, `customer_accounts`), so
 * `guardEntries` was empty in the running app and the generic CRUD path ran
 * zero guards. This module is enabled, so its guards actually reach the store.
 *
 * The two guards below are real policy, not demonstrations:
 *
 *   1. `entities.field_definition.no-reserved-key` — a custom field whose key
 *      collides with a system column (`id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`,
 *      `deleted_at`) is REFUSED. Today `records.ts` silently *strips* those
 *      keys from incoming values, which throws data away without telling the
 *      caller. A field definition that can never be written is a defect in
 *      the model, so it must be rejected at definition time, with a reason
 *      (dictionary standard S3: tell the user why).
 *
 *   2. `entities.field_definition.key-shape` — the key must be snake_case,
 *      matching the schema the definition API already enforces. Enforcing it
 *      here as well means an AI-authored or CLI-authored definition cannot
 *      slip a malformed key past the HTTP validator.
 */

/**
 * Columns owned by every dynamic-entity record. A custom field may not claim
 * one: it could never hold a value, because the record write path strips these
 * keys before persisting. Kept in sync with the strip list in
 * `api/records.ts` (the camelCase variants are accepted there because edit
 * forms echo the loaded record back).
