/**
 * CC-47 coverage gate — every human CRUD **list** route must declare a read gate.
 *
 * Row 15 (`P10`) claims "every read is filtered by permission at the data layer".
 * Its mechanism on the human path is **the route's own `metadata.<METHOD>.requireFeatures`**:
 * the API dispatcher loads a route module's `metadata` (`apps/mercato/src/app/api/
 * [...slug]/route.ts:367`), extracts the method entry (`:377` — `extractMethodMetadata`),
 * and calls `checkAuthorization(...)` (`:378`) — which resolves `rbac.userHasAllFeatures(...)`
 * and returns **403 Forbidden** before the handler runs (`:207-251`).
 *
 * That gate is enforced and present on essentially every list endpoint — so the missing
 * thing is not a gate but a **structural guarantee that a new route cannot be added
 * without one**. This test is that guard, analogous to `search-acl-coverage.test.ts`
 * (the `CC-46` search-path gate) and `core/src/__tests__/audit-coverage.test.ts`.
 *
 * What it checks — two INDEPENDENT assertions, both read via the TypeScript AST so a
 * gate word in a **comment** or a **string literal** can never grant a false pass:
 *   A. Every `route.ts` that builds with `makeCrudRoute` (the human CRUD family) declares a
 *      real GET read gate: a `requireFeatures` **property** in its `metadata.GET` (or `metadata`
 *      if flat), or it delegates to a listed `GATED_BUILDERS` builder, or it is on the explicit
 *      `HANDLER_GATED_ROUTES` list (routes that gate **inside** the handler).
 *   B. Every GET-exporting route's exported `metadata` is **DEMONSTRABLY** gated — a
 *      `requireFeatures` property, or a `requireAuth` that resolves to the literal `true` —
 *      OR it is a knowing public opt-out (`requireAuth` resolving to the literal `false`) and
 *      is on the pinned `PUBLIC_ROUTES` list. **Anything the checker cannot SEE to be gated is
 *      FLAGGED** — a spread, a helper call, a non-literal `requireAuth`, an object with no auth
 *      key, or metadata it cannot resolve — unless the route is on the pinned
 *      `DELEGATED_GATED_ROUTES` list with written evidence.
 *
 * WHY FAIL-CLOSED (this is the design, not an accident). Earlier versions of assertion B
 * tried to *prove a negative* by pattern-matching TypeScript ("no un-gated expression can
 * escape"). Each was defeated by the next shape a hostile critic found: a comment/string token;
 * `requireAuth: false`; a computed `['GET']`; a stray `resource:` property; `as const`; a spread;
 * a `requireAuth` that resolves to `false` through a const; `requireFeatures: []`; `['']`; an
 * unresolved identifier; a non-literal `GET:` value with a flat decoy; a `let` reassignment;
 * duplicate keys; `Object.assign`. That is an unwinnable arms race over a Turing-complete
 * language. So B inverted: it only accepts what it can *see* is a statically-read, non-vacuous
 * gate, and forces a HUMAN to vouch for everything else by name. The bound is explicit and
 * reviewable — the two exception lists — instead of open-ended. A twelfth pass found a
 * DISCOVERY gap rather than a detector gap: `exportsGet` only matched identifier-named `GET`
 * bindings, so the destructured `export const { GET, … } = builder(…)` form — the canonical CRUD
 * export shape — fell out of B's universe entirely; it is fixed above and the six routes it
 * newly surfaced are pinned in `DELEGATED_GATED_ROUTES`.
 *
 * Concretely, B accepts a route only when its exported `metadata` is a `const` binding holding
 * a plain object literal (possibly behind `as const`/parens and one local `const` hop), with
 * exactly one `GET` key whose value is a plain object literal, whose value's `requireFeatures`
 * is a non-empty array of non-empty string literals — OR the file does not mutate its metadata
 * binding anywhere. Everything else (spread, helper call, non-literal, duplicate key,
 * `let`+reassign, `Object.assign(metadata, …)`, unreadable identifier) is FLAGGED. Twelve
 * hostile-critic passes walked it; each hole is now a pinned self-check fixture, and the pass-12
 * discovery gap (destructured exports) is fixed and pinned.
 *
 * (Measured 2026-10-10 across all **296** GET-exporting route files — every form of `GET` export,
 * including the DESTRUCTURED `export const { GET, … } = builder(…)`: the great majority carry
 * a non-vacuous `requireFeatures` or a literal `requireAuth: true`; **9** are explicit-public
 * (pinned in PUBLIC_ROUTES), **31** are non-demonstrable and pinned in DELEGATED_GATED_ROUTES;
 * the two lists plus the demonstrable set must exhaust all 296.)
 *
 * Note the AST reads **properties**, so `GET: { /* requireFeatures *\/ }` (comment) and
 * `GET: { note: 'requireFeatures' }` (string) are correctly **not gating**.
 *
 * If this fails on a route you just added: add `requireFeatures` to its `GET` metadata (the
 * normal, declarative way); or, if it is genuinely public, write a literal `requireAuth: false`
 * AND add it to `PUBLIC_ROUTES`; or, if its gate is built elsewhere, add it to
 * `DELEGATED_GATED_ROUTES` with the file+line that gates it. A handler-level gate goes in
 * `HANDLER_GATED_ROUTES`.
 *
 * Scope note (honest). What this test does NOT cover, stated plainly so no reader infers more:
 *   - Assertion A covers the `makeCrudRoute` family only (60 files). A route that builds through a
 *     DIFFERENT helper (`makeSalesLineRoute`, `makeDashboardWidgetRoute`, `makeStatusDictionaryRoute`,
 *     the `buildDocumentCrudOptions` family, …) is NOT audited by A.
 *   - Assertion B covers routes that EXPORT a `GET` (296 files, all export forms). A route that
 *     serves a list read without exporting a `GET` binding is outside both.
 *   - The union of A and B is not all 457 route files: **161** files are in neither, and every one of
 *     them is a mutation endpoint (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) — **zero export a `GET`** (measured 2026-10-10
 *     by three independent routes: a comment-stripped regex scan, a TypeScript-AST walk, and a union
 *     computation; the earlier figure "163" was the *pre-fix* value, before the destructured-export fix
 *     lifted B from 287 to 296 — see the discovery-gap note above; the two files that moved,
 *     `sales/api/order-lines` and `sales/api/quote-lines`, are `makeSalesLineRoute` lists).
 *     CC-47 is scoped to the *human CRUD list* path, so that is intended, not a gap. Where a
 *     genuine GET list falls outside both nets it must be visible, not silent — hence the pinned
 *     `DELEGATED_GATED_ROUTES` list, which now names the two `makeSalesLineRoute` line lists.
 *   - B's guarantee is: no route whose exported `metadata` B can read is silently exempt from
 *     declaring its auth posture; anything B cannot see is FLAGGED and must be a human-vouched
 *     exception. B can NOT prove a builder's metadata is gated — it can only force a human to name it.
 * The factory's own GET hard-returns 401 when there is no authenticated context
 * (`packages/shared/src/lib/crud/factory.ts:1474`), so the `makeCrudRoute` family can never serve
 * rows unauthenticated regardless of metadata; A's guarantee is *per-entity permission scoping*.
 *
 * The sanity test below **pins the exact measured discovery counts** (457 route files, 60
 * makeCrudRoute routes, 296 GET-exporting routes, 2 handler exemptions) rather than using loose
 * floors, so a walker that silently stops scanning `apps/` (or any directory) fails loudly.
