/**
 * Canonical serialisation for the hash-chained ledger (R3, Tier 1).
 *
 * A hash chain is only as trustworthy as the bytes it hashes. If two runs can
 * serialise the same event differently — a reordered key, a `2` where there was
 * a `2.0`, a lost `-0` — verification fails on untampered data, and a ledger
 * that cries wolf is worse than no ledger: people learn to ignore it.
 *
 * So serialisation here is deliberately narrow and total. Every value either has
 * exactly one representation or is rejected outright. Nothing is coerced
 * silently, because a silent coercion is a hash that cannot be reproduced from
 * the original input.
 *
 * This is close to RFC 8785 (JCS) in spirit. It does not claim to be JCS: JCS
 * inherits JavaScript's number formatting, and we reject the ambiguous cases
 * instead of encoding them.

 * instances so the event envelope has exactly one representation. Snapshots of
 * business records are the opposite — they contain prices, timestamps and
 * whatever an entity happens to hold, and none of that is negotiable.
 *
 * Running a strict canonicaliser over them would throw. Since a ledger append is
 * fail-closed, that throw would roll back the customer's write: the audit
 * mechanism would become the thing that breaks the business. So values of
 * unknown shape get this instead — total, never throwing, and deterministic for
 * the same input:
 *
 * - object keys sorted, `undefined` and functions dropped
 * - `Date` as its ISO string, `BigInt` as decimal digits
 * - non-finite numbers as their names, so they hash rather than vanish
 * - anything else stringified rather than refused
 *
 * The trade-off is explicit: this digest is reproducible by another JavaScript
 * runtime, not necessarily by another language, because it inherits JS number
 * formatting. That is acceptable here — the digest proves a snapshot has not
 * changed, and the party checking that is the platform. The envelope hash, which
 * an outside auditor verifies, uses the strict encoder.
